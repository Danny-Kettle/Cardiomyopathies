    Cardiomyopathy (kahr-dee-o-my-OP-uh-thee) is a condition affecting the heart muscle, which can
    result in reduced blood-pumping ability and hinder the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the
    body's tissues. If left untreated, cardiomyopathy may progress to heart failure, a serious and
    potentially life-threatening condition.
  </p>

  <p class="px-4 py-6 mt-5 pt-0 ml-10 text-md lg:text-lg -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">
    The main types of cardiomyopathy include dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
    Treatment — which might include medications, surgically implanted devices or, in severe cases, a
    heart transplant — depends on which type of cardiomyopathy you have and how serious it is.
